LAB 8 MANUAL
MASTERMIND
To play, flip switch 9. This resets the game. Flip switch 0 to pick a random 4 bit base 4 code.
Use KEY3 to guess a 3, KEY2 to guess a 2, KEY1 to guess a 1, and KEY0 to guess a zero. Your guesses
will appear in order in HEX3:0. After you have guessed four digits, the number of digits that you have
guessed correctly in the correct places will appear in HEX5. The number of digits that you have guessed
correctly in incorrect places will appear in HEX4. To refresh the guess screen, push any key and guess
again. LEDR9:0 will display the number of guesses you have used so far, in binary. When HEX5 displays a
4, you have guessed all four digits correctly and won the game.
